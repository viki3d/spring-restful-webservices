## Representational state transfer (REST)

### What is REST?

Representational state transfer (REST) is a __software architectural style__
that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the 
World Wide Web.  

Any web service that obeys the REST constraints is informally described as
__RESTful__. Such a web service must provide its **_Web resources_** in a textual 
representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol 
and a predefined set of operations.  

**_Web resource_** is every thing, entity, or action that can be identified, 
named, addressed, handled, or performed in any way on the Web.  

The goal of REST is to increase performance, scalability, simplicity, 
modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability. This is achieved 
through following REST principles such as a client–server architecture, 
statelessness, cacheability, use of a layered system, support for code on 
demand, and using a uniform interface. These principles must be followed for the
system to be classified as REST.  

### Architectural constraints

 * Client–server architecture  
 * Statelessness  
 * Cacheability  
 * Layered system  
 * Code on demand (optional)  
 * Uniform interface
